            <h1>The Wilson Barn Story:</h1>
            <p>Ira Wilson was born in 1867, and began his career in dairy farming at an early age, working on the farm owned by his family since 1847. He built a barn on this site in 1888; in 1919 the barn burned and he built the present structure on the foundations of the earlier barn. Wilson eventually established a million-dollar dairy, creamery, and trucking business, the Ira Wilson & Sons Dairy, and served for two terms as Wayne County sheriff. Wilson died in 1944, and the lower level of the barn was converted for use as a horse stable in the same year.</p>
            <p>As of 1980, the Wilson Barn is managed by "The Friends of the Barn", a volunteer group.  The Barn hosts a farmers market from July to October, a car show in mid summer, and a pumpkinfest in October.  We rent the barn for weddings, parties and functions of your choice.  Volunteers are always welcome.</p>


            <p>The Wilson barn is a National Historic Site.  The Friends of the Barn was established to preserve Livonia's historical dairy farm.  We offer a variety of events including a Farmer's Market, Pumpkin Fest, and a Car Show.  You are invited to participate in these events or join the many volunteers who contribute to the preservation of one of Livona's treasured site.  Volunteers are always welcome.  All events are smoke and alcohol free.</p>
